<!-- The [Machine Learning in Medical Image Analysis (MLMIA)](https://mlmia-unitue.de) group is currently inviting applications for the following positions:

## PhD student (m/f/d, E13 TV-L; 65%) in Robust Machine Learning for Medical Image Analysis

**Project description**  
The aim of this project is to develop rigorous, mathematically founded techniques to assess the robustness of automated medical image analysis systems and to investigate methods for providing provable guarantees of an algorithms performance under variations in the image acquisition process.

Medical imaging data frequently are subject to systematic changes in appearance originating from different acquisition parameters or different imaging hardware. Unfortunately, modern deep learning systems have been shown to be extremely sensitive to such variations, to the point where an algorithm trained with data from one hospital, may not work on data acquired at a different hospital. Formally assessing the robustness of machine learning methods, building more robust techniques, and providing guarantees for the performance of such techniques is of utmost importance for these methods to be eventually deployed in clinical practice. Thus, the successful candidate will contribute directly to one of the big unsolved problems hindering wide-spread adoption of AI technology for medical image analysis.

**Who we are looking for**  
You are curious, enjoy analytical thinking and have a passion for science. You have a strong academic background, are motivated to do machine learning research, and have keen interest to solve real-world clinical problems. You hold a M.Sc. degree (or similar) in quantitative discipline such as machine learning, mathematics, statistics, physics, computer science, or similar fields. Ideally, you have prior experience with deep neural networks, and strong programming skills in Python.

Note: A B.Sc. degree is not sufficient to qualify for this position.

**What we offer**  
This is a project jointly supervised by [Dr. Christian Baumgartner](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/research-groups/ml-in-medical-image-analysis/) and [Prof. Matthias Hein](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/maschinelles-lernen/team/prof-dr-matthias-hein/), and thus is truly at the intersection between state-of-the-art machine learning and medical image analysis. The successful candidate will work at the [Cluster of Excellence "Machine Learning - New Perspectives for Science"](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/) and will benefit from this vibrant research environment as well as from the activities and events organized by the cluster and associated institutions.

If you have any questions about the position, please do not hesitate to contact Christian directly. The university seeks to raise the number of women in research and teaching and therefore urges qualified women scientists to apply for these positions. Equally qualified applicants with disabilities will be given preference. The employment will be carried out by the central administration of the University of Tübingen. Please submit your application by May 2nd, 2021.

## PhD Student (E13 TV-L, 65%, m/f/d) in Interpretable Machine Learning for Medical Image Analysis

 **Project description**  
The introduction of deep learning has revolutionised medical image analysis along with many other fields. Yet, despite the fact that neural network technology is now ubiquitous and deep learning algorithms are routinely used in many every day applications, they are rarely employed in practical clinical applications. A major reason for this is that standard deep learning methods are black boxes and cannot explain their reasoning. This causes clinicians to lack trust in the technology, is at the root of ethical and legal issues when neither the doctor nor the patient understand an algorithmic decision, and complicates certification of machine learning based products thus preventing commercialisation and transfer into clinical practice.

The aim of this project is to develop inherently interpretable machine learning techniques by combining neural network based learning algorithms with clinically known patterns and, in particular, clinically known reasoning. Explicitly using this a-priori known information is likely to facilitate learning, will lead to more robust representations, and ultimately may form a new foundation for clinically accepted deep learning models. The successful candidate will perform research at the intersection between medical applications and machine learning. A particular methodological focus will be on combining known representations with learned representations and further processing them with ideas from machine reasoning.

**What we are looking for**  
You have a strong academic background and hold an M.Sc., or equivalent degree in a quantitative discipline such as computer science, physics, mathematics, statistics, electrical engineering, or biomedical engineering. You are self-driven, curious, and enjoy analytical thinking. You have a strong motivation to do machine learning research as well as a keen interest to solve real-world clinical problems. Ideally, you have prior experience with machine learning, and strong programming skills in Python. Prior experience working with medical imaging data is a plus, but not required.

Note: A B.Sc. degree is not sufficient to qualify for this position.

**What we offer**  
This project will be conducted in the [Machine Learning in Medical Image Analysis (MLMIA)](https://mlmia-unitue.de) group under the supervision of [Dr. Christian Baumgartner](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/research-groups/ml-in-medical-image-analysis/). The group is located in the machine learning building of the University of Tübingen, together with the [Cluster of Excellence “Machine Learning: New Perspectives for Science”](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/), which the group is part of, and [Tübingen AI Center](https://tuebingen.ai/). As such, the successful candidate will be embedded in an extraordinarily vibrant machine learning community in which regular exchanges of ideas and collaborations are common. The MLMIA group also greatly values the direct exchange with clinical partners from the [University Hospital Tübingen](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/startseite).

## Postdoctoral Researcher (E13 TV-L, 100%, m/f/d) in Machine Learning for Medical Image Analysis

We invite applications for a fully-funded postdoctoral position in the [Machine Learning in Medical Image Analysis (MLMIA)](https://mlmia-unitue.de) group led by [Dr. Christian Baumgartner](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/research-groups/ml-in-medical-image-analysis/). The main research question we try to answer in the MLMIA group is "How can we bring machine learning technology to clinical medical imaging practice?". Far from being solved, this question requires novel and creative approaches to numerous hard machine learning challenges. The main research focus of the MLMIA group is the development of methods that enable collaboration between humans and AI systems, in particular techniques for uncertainty quantification, interpretabiliy of predictions, and human-in-the-loop systems. A further focus is the application of generative modelling approaches to large medical imaging cohorts in order to better understand physiological and pathological processes and their connection to extraneous factors.

The successful candidate will be given the opportunity to shape their own research agenda within the confines of the group's motivation.

**What we are looking for**
