I am a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Oviedo. My thesis, titled "Improving Biomedical Image Analysis through Deep Learning Techniques," aims to explore and develop innovative approaches to enhance biomedical imaging by leveraging advanced computer vision methods.



<!-- Research Areas
======
My research focuses on developing machine learning methodologies that bridge the gap between ML theory and clinical applications. Specifically, I am interested in technologies facilitating human-AI collaboration, as well as using probabilistic modelling to discover disease effects and connections between clinical variables. I am pursuing those goals along the following directions:

 * **Safety and uncertainty**: In medical image analysis, confidently predicting something false can have devastating consequences. Hence, it is crucial to develop machine learning algorithms that reflect the various uncertainties in the medical image analysis pipeline and can help clinical practitioners to safely use this technology in practice.

* **Learning efficiently with fewer data**: Obtaining annotated data is very expensive in the medical field because only clinical professionals can do it. How can we learn with fewer data, and how can we obtain training data that are optimal for a certain task? 

* **Interpretable machine learning**: It is clear that artificial intelligence is in no position to replace clinicians and will not be for a long time, if ever. Therefore, we must develop techniques to allow clinicians and patients to optimally interface with machine learning algorithms. One important aspect of this question is making algorithmic decision processes transparent.

* **Human-in-the-loop systems**: Humans are an essential component in every ML system in multiple ways: they provide training data, they select and train the model, they operate the system. Thus it makes sense to put emphasis on the human role in this process for instance by developing techniques for reducing annotation effort, active learning, and interactive predictions. 

* **Exploiting shared information between tasks**: Often algorithms are learned from scratch for each new problem. Taking into account that many problems are related in various ways can help us create more intelligent algorithms. 

 * **Discovering effects in big medical data**: Recent advances in probabilistic machine learning techniques offer a unique opportunity to explore datasets with ten thousands of images (such as the [German National Cohort Study](https://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/radiologische-klinik/klinik-fuer-diagnostische-und-interventionelle-radiologie/forschung/research-projects/the-german-national-cohort)) to better understand disease processes. -->

Short Bio
======
In 2016, I completed my degree in Physics at the Complutense University of Madrid. Since then, I have worked as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer across various companies, industries, and countries. During this period, I also earned a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence Research, specializing in Learning and Data Science.

In September 2022, I embarked on a new and challenging journey by enrolling in a PhD program. My research focuses on the development and application of deep learning techniques for medical image analysis. I aim to identify critical gaps within the field that can be addressed to make a tangible clinical impact, and to create innovative and effective solutions for existing challenges. So far, I have had the opportunity to work on exciting topics such as brain tumor segmentation, breast cancer detection enhancement, and more.

Looking ahead, my primary goal is to continue my career as a researcher or professional in the healthcare sector, where I can apply and further develop my expertise in Artificial Intelligence to improve medical diagnostics and treatments.
