My research interests focus on exploring how artificial intelligence, specifically computer vision techniques, can be 
used to enhance patient prognosis in the medical field. I strongly believe that AI can help physicians and healthcare
professionals in the near future by accelerating the diagnosis process and offering more personalized medicine. 
Therefore, any advance in medical image analysis is a step forward in the right direction.



Brain tumors
-----


As an AI researcher specializing in applying computer vision techniques to the field of brain tumor segmentation, my research is centered on leveraging deep learning and advanced image analysis methodologies to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of medical imaging in neuro-oncology. Specifically, I am interested in developing lightweight automated systems that can precisely delineate brain tumors from MRI scans while decreasing the computational cost for treating brain cancers such as gliomas.

Despite the fact that large models are the gold standard nowadays, I consider green AI in medical imaging an area to be explored in detail. Enhancing techniques to address the environmental and computational costs of training large AI models, particularly brain tumor segmentation where models are often computationally expensive, would reduce the carbon footprint. Developing more efficient lightweight models and optimizing training pipelines while maintaining high performance will be key in the near future.

Breast cancer
-----

Another research topic I am involved in is the breast cancer domain. I am particularly interested in developing multi-task learning systems to address both tumor segmentation and classification simultaneously, leveraging the natural correlation between these tasks to improve performance and generalizability.

My research aims to overcome key challenges in the field, such as data standardization issues and the exclusion of non-tumor images during training, which often lead to biased and non-clinically applicable CAD systems. A significant part of my work involves curating publicly available breast cancer datasets to mitigate biases that arise from poor-quality data. By doing so, the goal of our work is to advance the research community by promoting more reliable practices and reducing the potential harm of using low-quality datasets in scientific achievements.
